Overview
Welcome to the AI-powered Energy Management System (AIEMS) project by Team Stellar. This initiative aims to address the challenges faced by industrial and commercial facilities in managing energy consumption effectively. The lack of visibility and control over energy usage often leads to increased costs and environmental impact. Our solution leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and data analytics to optimize energy consumption.

Problem Statement
Developing an AI-powered energy management system for industrial and commercial facilities to optimize energy consumption.

Challenges:
Lack of visibility and control over energy usage
Conventional energy management systems limitations
Manual intervention required for effective operation
Solution
The AIEMS collects real-time energy data from various sources, including sensors and meters. Machine learning algorithms analyze this data to predict energy usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. The system provides recommendations for energy-efficient practices and automates control of energy-consuming devices.

Key Features:
Real-time energy data collection
Machine learning for energy consumption optimization
Automation of energy-consuming devices
Scalable and adaptable to different facilities
User-friendly interface for easy monitoring and control
Desired Outcome
The goal is to help businesses:

Reduce energy costs
Improve operational efficiency
Minimize environmental impact
Idea's Description
To build AIEMS, we focus on collecting data through IoT components from individual machines. Health Profiles for each machine help identify and minimize faults, ensuring smooth operations. Anomalies in machine power consumption patterns are detected and corrected, reducing unnecessary power use. Automation ensures machines operate only when necessary, saving power and reducing electricity bills.

Strategies:
Health Profiles for machine maintenance
Anomaly detection for efficient power use
Automation for optimal machine activity
Adaptation to changing power supply thresholds
